# Descriptive & Inferential Statistics Mini Project

This project provides a foundational understanding of Descriptive and Inferential Statistics through theory and hands-on problem-solving using Python in a Google Colab notebook. It is ideal for students or beginners looking to build statistical reasoning skills and apply them to real-world datasets.

## üìå Project Objectives

- Understand key statistical definitions and concepts.
- Perform manual calculations for mean, median, mode, variance, and standard deviation.
- Explore data types and levels of measurement.
- Calculate confidence intervals and perform hypothesis testing.
- Interpret results for informed data-driven decision-making.

## üìÅ Contents

### Q1. Key Statistical Definitions
Short definitions of core statistical terms, including population, sample, descriptive statistics, and inferential statistics.

### Q2. Measures of Central Tendency - Definitions
Understanding mean, median, and mode with examples.

### Q3. Manual Calculation of Mean, Median, and Mode
Applying formulas to a given dataset to find central tendency measures.

### Q4. Levels of Measurement
Definition and example for nominal, ordinal, interval, and ratio data.

### Q5. Variance and Standard Deviation - Theory
Conceptual explanation and comparison of variance and standard deviation.

### Q6. Manual Calculation - Variance and Standard Deviation
Hands-on practice with sample data.

### Q7. Range and Interquartile Range (IQR)
Calculate range, quartiles, and IQR from given data.

### Q8. Five-Number Summary and Boxplot Concept
Understanding data distribution and outlier detection.

### Q9. Confidence Interval for the Mean
Calculating a 95% confidence interval using sample statistics.

### Q10. Hypothesis Testing - One Sample Z-Test
Performing a Z-test to determine statistical significance.

## üõ† Tools Used

- Python
- Google Colab
- Libraries: NumPy, Pandas, SciPy, Matplotlib (if visualization is added)


## ‚úÖ Expected Outcomes

- Build conceptual clarity in statistics.
- Gain practical experience in statistical computation.
- Learn to interpret data and make informed decisions using inferential techniques.
